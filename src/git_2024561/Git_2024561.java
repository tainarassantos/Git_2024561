 * Homework Submission - 3%
The purpose of this Homework is to make sure that you can set up and use git & github with Netbeans.

TASK AS FOLLOWS
1) Set up a NEW PROJECT using Git_xxxxxxx as the project name, where xxxxxxx is your Student ID number (e.g. Git_2024999)
2) Initialise the Git repository and commit the (empty!) project.
3) Publish it to github. It is probably easiest to do this using git desktop.
IMPORTANT -- Make sure that you make this public! There is a 'tick box' that sets the project as private, so make sure this is NOT TICKED!
4) Add a line of code to your project with a simple output. This should print your name and student ID. (e.g. System.out.println(" Ken - 2024999")
5) Commit the change with a simple commit message (e.g. 'added a simple print') and use git desktop to push the change to github. Note that this should mean that you have 2 commits on your project.
6) Upload the github URL for this project here. You just need to upload a .txt file with the URL
LAST CHECK -- Go to the repository ("repo") on github. After the name, it should say 'public'. If it is private then you MUST change this! Click Settings. Scroll to the bottom ('Danger Zone') and select 'Change visibility' and you will be able to 'Change to Public'.
DO NOT UPLOAD ANY CODE TO MOODLE! YOUR TASK IS TO HAVE THE PROJECT ON GITHUB!
ONLY .txt FILES WILL BE ACCEPTED HERE!
